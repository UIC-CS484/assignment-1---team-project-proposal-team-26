# Proposal for final project - team 26
 
Since it is a single member team, I just plan to have the main branch and the github pages branch. I will do most of my work on main and push when I think the site is ready to the github pages branch.

Members - single member team - Lokesh Roopkumar - responsibilities include doing everything. I hope I get extra credit for having the courage to do it alone and not having any team members to split the work up.

I will be using react.js, node.js, express.js, passport.js, SQLite for my final project.
