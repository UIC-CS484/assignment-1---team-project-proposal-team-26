                    There could be redundant groups. <br>
                    Anyone would be able to see/join a list of all groups that exist within an organization. <br>

                    <h4>Accessibility Implementation</h4> <br>
                    Either, add a form element that would allow the user to adjust the font size,
                    or have a slider to toggle between light mode and dark mode.
